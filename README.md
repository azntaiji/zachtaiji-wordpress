Personal website

# About
This is my personal website built on a docker multi container app with Wordpress, Nginx, MySql, PHP-FPM, Phpmyadmin, and Certbot on Alpine Linux.

The host is my old (not really that old as I did a refresh on the components ~1 year ago) hackintosh that I've repurposed as a server, since I'm now using a 2021 MacBook Pro M1 Pro as my daily driver. I'm using Cloudflare to manage my server's DNS and open it to the interwebs. Hackintosh specs:

- OS: Vanilla MacOS Mojave 10.14.6
- Bootloader: Clover
- Mobo: Gigabyte Z390 M GAMING w/ Thunderbolt 3
- CPU: i7 8700k 3.7 GHz Intel Core i7
- RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32 GB 2400 MHz DDR4
- GPU: Sapphire Radeon RX 580 8 GB Pulse
- PSU: EVGA BQ 600 W 80+
- Storage: SSDs and HDDs. One day I'll upgrade to NVMEs...
- Other stuff: Watercooled (AIO), dual boot Windows 10, fancy LEDs
